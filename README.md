# Maze Game
This project is an extension of a Data Structures and Algorithms class project I created. The original function was creating a recursive method that allowed the computer to traverse a maze and eventually find a solution, as seen in Maze.Java.

After utilizing Java's Swing UI, this was changed into a Maze Game where the user could choose between an Easy and Hard Maze, and then try to solve it on their own. If they cannot, then the correct solution can be displayed.
